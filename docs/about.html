    <p class="pt-4 text-center mx-16">Tired of sundering important relationships with your friends and family 
        via charged political posts on Facebook? Are you BORED of getting fired over that Tweet your coworker deemed 
        "insensitive" or "culturally problematic?"
        Well, tire and bore no longer, for you can now do those very same things on yet another NEW social media space,
        STOOPNEGGLE CENTRAL! Follow your friends, then unfollow them when they make an absurd post about a political topic
        you feel strongly about! (And don't worry, we'll make sure they are subtly alerted with a soft, gentle 
        A-OOOGHA horn that will pop up on their phone regardless of the hour, and cannot be silenced without 
        unlocking their device!) Want to find out what the latest insane tin-foil hat conspiracy Uncle Mel is pedalling this week?
        Well your in luck! Look up that dear old Uncle Mel and smack some sense into his turkey goiter. Then block him when
        he sends you an unfriending A-OOOGHA in a petty act of defiance despite his action of unfriending you in the first 
        place sort of implying that he wasn't planning on talking to you again anytime soon to begin with. 
        (Well, at least until your forced to sit across from him at Thanksgiving. Hooray!!!1!1) And with a singular, epic 
        chatroom containing a live stream of comments from all our users all over the world, you can get caught up in the convo 
        before you can even scream "it wasn't me! It was the Ambien!!!" 
        So what are you waiting for? With all these Doofy possibiities and more, the future is nigh, and it has one big screaming, 
        exhilarating question for you...
        ...are you a Doofus, or are you a Dallant? 
                
            And moreover, how many Stoops can your Doofs neggle?

        attempting to navigate it?"
        You can find me in my room most days, listening to Skynd and coding terrible videogames.
        Or banging on the piano loudly and badly much to my dearest mother's chagrin.

        Gilded era of New York. The Gilded era, that sweet, wonderful period just before 
        prohibition, when the Charleston was but a glimmer in the eyes of Ward McAllister
